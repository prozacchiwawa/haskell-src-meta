The `haskell-src-meta` Package  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/haskell-src-meta.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-meta) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanBurton/haskell-src-meta.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DanBurton/haskell-src-meta)
==================

`haskell-src-meta` is a package originally by Matt Morrow for converting a
parsed AST from `haskell-src-exts` to a TH AST for use in splices and
quasiquoters. The last version Matt released before he disappeared from the
Haskell community was 0.0.6, but by that time his library was already popular,
so some community members eventually decided to take over maintenance of the
package, keeping it up to date with the latest versions of TH etc.

I don't really view this as "my" package so if you want write access to
the github repository, or you think you could do a better job as
maintainer, just ask.

The above was written by Ben Millwood,
but I (Dan Burton) share the same sentiment.
